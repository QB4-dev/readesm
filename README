ReadESM - digital tachograph file reader

This program takes an ESM file, as downloaded from a digital tachograph or a
driver card, a compulsory equipment for trucks heavier than 3.5 tons within the
European Union. It converts said files into human-readable form, either HTML or
simple plaintext.

See the help.html file in the homepage folder for help.
